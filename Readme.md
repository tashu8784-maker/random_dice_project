I recently worked on a small Python project called “Random Dice Simulator”, designed to demonstrate how randomness works in Python using the random module.

In this project, I created a virtual dice that generates outcomes (1–6) randomly, simulating the natural probability of rolling a dice. The project helped me understand key Python concepts such as:
🔹 Random number generation
🔹 Loops and conditionals
🔹 User input and output handling
🔹 Logic building and reproducibility of random events

Tech Stack:
🐍 Python
📦 random library
💻 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

This was a fun and insightful way to strengthen my logic-building and Python fundamentals.
